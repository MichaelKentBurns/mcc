# The structured repository for mcc development in 2025/6

What makes this different from the XCode-mcc repository is that XCode seems to want a flat structure where all .h and .c files are at the top level of the repository.

In contrast, the way we often did C projects before was with different src, include, doc, obj subdirectories. 
This is one of those.
